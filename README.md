# MovieBusters-Film-Data-Analysis

The movie industry has been filled with intruiging what-ifs. It can be Will Smith turning down the role of Neo in the Matrix. Nicholas Cage had been cast as Superman, but he only had time to try out the Superman costume before the movie got cancelled. The industry has been characterized by uncertainty which has left fans wondering what might have been.

But, for peoplpe behind the camera, this uncertainity is not good enough. With MovieBusters, our goal is to reduce the erraticness and help movie houses with the decision making process which is backed with data and AI. We aim at using historical film data acquired from sources like IMDB and The Numbers to tease out hidden patterns which can aid filmmakers like editors, writers, directors and actors in taking the right decision.

The dataset scrapped from the above websites consist of film reated attributes like the year, the crew, boxoffice collection, audiience reviews and the movie summary. This data is cleaned to set the stage for further processing which is then followed by analysis and predictions based on machine learning.
